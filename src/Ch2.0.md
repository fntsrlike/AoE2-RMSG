Chapter 2: TERRAINS & OBJECTS
---

Here are the lists of available item types, including:
-	Predefined constant name, if any (otherwise use #const).
-	Constant number N, to be used for name definitions: #const  name  N
-	Comments, if needed
I reported only items that look good enough to be useful in a RMS. For a complete list of constants, including defective stuff, see the Constant Numbers Guides which Iâ€™ve linked in section 5.3.1.
