Chapter 5 LINKS AND RESOURCES
---

This section will only cover a few key sources and tools.  For a more complete overview please visit this forum post at the Age of Kings Heaven: http://aok.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action=ct&f=28,42485,,30
Feel free to contact me if you know of any useful resources that I have missed.

## 5.1. Guides

Updated New Random Map Scripting Guide by: Zetnus (this guide!)
Currently the most up-to-date guide. It might be worth checking the link to see if I’ve published a newer version. http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=12178

(outdated) Random Map Scripting Guide (RMSG.doc) by: Ensemble Studios
Provided in the docs folder on your CD or in Age2HD\Docs\All if you have the HD Edition on Steam. Has numerous errors, mistakes and omissions; so don’t trust everything written there! Contains an annotated version of the script for Coastal. http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=11773

## 5.2. Editors and Generators
Yes, you can write your script in just about any text editor, but these programs can make random map scripting much easier and faster. Some of them let you auto-generate whole chunks of code, or whole map scripts. Others provide features like syntax highlighting – which is very helpful for finding typos.

RMS Toolkit by: chasqui
The most comprehensive editor currently available for random map scripting. I strongly recommend using this if you are a somewhat experienced scripter, or if you plan on spending any significant amount of time working with rms files.  It is a bit complicated to use at first, but definitely worth learning. Comes with syntax highlighting and various other useful features. http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=7921

RMS Creator by: chasqui
Lets you auto-generate a script in Word, and offers quite a bit of scope for customizing the auto-generation. Great for beginners or casual scripters. http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=8023

RMS syntax support for Notepad++ (UDL) by: Axa
An addon with syntax highlighting for free text editor Notepad++.  Very comprehensive.

RMS Language For Notepad++ by: ephestion
Another addon with rms syntax highlighting for the free text editor Notepad++.  Not as advanced as the one above.

## 5.3. Reference Lists and other Utilities

Setup Map by: scripter64
This is a utility that lets you generate your script in the Scenario Editor (by replacing one or two of the maps in the gamedata). If you are using the HD Edition or the UP, you should NOT use this because both of those already let you generate custom maps in the scenario editor. Also, this will prevent you from playing multiplayer while it active.

UserPatch Script Reference http://userpatch.aiscripters.net/reference.html
AgeII HD Script Reference http://steamcommunity.com/app/221380/discussions/0/684839199943495537/
The official documentation of the new UP and HD scripting commands.  The HD one contains a few typos.


### 5.3.1 RMS Constants
The tables earlier in this guide include most of the useful constants. However, if you want complete lists, those can be found here.

Complete List by: DiGiT (.csv) http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=5810
Easily searchable, because it’s all in a single spreadsheet.

Advanced List by: OtmShankIiI (.htm) http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=8724
Much better descriptions and slightly more up-to-date than the complete list above. (This one is also "complete")

AoF and AK Constants by: Zetnus (.xls) http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=8724
Only includes the constants from the expansions "The Forgotten" and "African Kingdoms" on Steam.

Terrain Names Spreadsheet by: Zetnus (.xls) http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=12226
All the terrain constants with descriptions of the terrains and their functions.

## 5.5. Community sites
I have focused on ones that could be specifically relevant for RM scripting.

http://aok.heavengames.com/
The "blacksmith" is one of the best repositories for Age of Empires II content (including lots of random map scripts). Publish your maps here.  Check out the forums if you have any scripting-related questions that need answering.

http://www.aoczone.net/
Home of the competitive international Age of Empires II community. If you want to design a map for specifically for competitive gameplay, this is might be a good site to look at.

http://www.hawkaoc.net/
Home of the Chinese Age of Empires II community.  If you can read Chinese, there are some good RMS-related resources available there.

http://steamcommunity.com/app/221380/
Age II HD on Steam. If you want a large audience and immediate exposure, then consider publishing your map in the Steam Workshop.
